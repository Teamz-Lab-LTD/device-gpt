                Power consumption measures how much energy your device uses, measured in watts (W) or milliwatts (mW).
                
                🔋 **Why It Matters:**
                • Higher power consumption = faster battery drain
                • Different components consume different amounts of power
                • Power consumption varies based on usage patterns
                
                📊 **How We Measure:**
                • Uses real system data from your device's BatteryManager
                • Formula: Power = Voltage × Current (P = V × I)
                • Based on research from leading universities and tech companies
                
                💡 **Key Insights:**
                • Display brightness is often the biggest power consumer
                • CPU usage spikes can significantly impact battery life
                • Network signal strength affects power consumption
                • Background apps can drain battery even when screen is off

                • LCD displays consume more power at higher brightness levels
                • AMOLED displays are more power-efficient, especially with dark content
                • Reducing brightness by 50% can save up to 40% display power
                • Auto-brightness helps optimize power based on ambient light
                
                💡 **Tips to Reduce Display Power:**
                • Use auto-brightness
                • Use dark mode/theme when available (especially on AMOLED)
                • Reduce screen timeout duration

                • CPU power consumption is related to frequency and utilization
                • Higher CPU frequencies consume exponentially more power
                • Background processes can keep CPU active and drain battery
                • Modern CPUs use dynamic frequency scaling to optimize power
                
                💡 **Tips to Reduce CPU Power:**
                • Close unnecessary background apps
